# Automation-projects
Here I have collected a different bunch of programs written in python. They are mainly used to automate menial and everyday tasks. I will start with programs that are very basic and gradually advance

## Collatz Sequence
Will take an integer input. If input is even, it will return input / 2, if it is odd, it will return input * 3 + 1. This will continue till the return is reduced to 1. Amazingly enough for any integer, you will soon arrive to 1.
This is called the "Collatz Sequence"
